# From Vision to Story: Structuring Agile Product Development

## Introduction
Before any feature is implemented, there must be a clear understanding of **why** it exists. A well-articulated **Product Vision** provides direction, while **Epics**, **Features**, and **User Stories** break that vision down into actionable development units. In this exercise, you will learn how to derive implementable work from a product-level goal and practice writing structured user-facing requirements.

A strong **Product Vision** expresses the intended impact of a product:
- *"Help students collaborate by providing a shared digital workspace."*
- *"Enable small businesses to automate invoice handling with zero coding knowledge."*

From this, you can define **Epics** like "Collaborative Editing" or "Invoice Parsing" and break them down into more manageable **Features** and **User Stories**, e.g.:
- *Epic:* Collaborative Editing
  - *Feature:* Real-time shared documents
    - *Story:* As a user, I want to see edits from my teammates in real time so we can work together more efficiently.

This structured breakdown allows teams to implement purpose-driven software iteratively and transparently.

## Tasks
1. Write a clear Product Vision for a fictional or real-world web-based product. Use the format:
   - Who is it for?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What value does it provide?

2. Create one Epic that logically follows from your Vision.
   - Add at least two Features to your Epic.
   - Break down each Feature into at least one User Story using the format:
     *As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].*

3. Annotate one of your User Stories with:
   - Acceptance criteria (in Given/When/Then or checklist format)
   - At least two concrete development tasks needed to implement the story

## Questions
- How does the Product Vision influence what *not* to build?
- What is the benefit of writing Features and Epics before User Stories?
- What distinguishes a good User Story from a vague wish?
- How do acceptance criteria help clarify scope and validate completion?

## Advice
A clear Product Vision helps you stay focused and avoid scope creep. Keep your Epics broad but meaningful, and ensure each User Story can stand alone and be tested independently. Discuss your stories with peers or mentors—collaborative refinement leads to better shared understanding and better software.
